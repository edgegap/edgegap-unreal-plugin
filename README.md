## Overview

The Edgegap Unreal Plugin is designed to streamline your game server deployment process, allowing you to focus on what really matters: your game. With minimal configuration, you can have your game server up and running on a remote, deployed server within minutes.

## Features

1. **Create an app on our platform:** No need to manually set up an app; the plugin does it for you.
2. **Package your game server for Linux:** Automatically packages your game server in a Linux-compatible format.
3. **Build the container:** Constructs a Docker container for your game server.
4. **Push the game server container to your private registry:** Your game server container is securely pushed to your private registry.
5. **Create a new app version for the pushed container:** A new version of your app is created automatically.

This is an excellent alternative to traditional CICD pipelines, making your server development process faster and more straightforward.
